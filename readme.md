# 📚 My Personal Swift Learning Repository 🚀

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my personal repository where I'm learning Swift. 

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Swift, the powerful and intuitive programming language for Apple operating systems like iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

## 💯 100 Days of Swift

I'm excited to announce that I'm embarking on the "100 Days of Swift" challenge. This means I'll be coding in Swift and pushing updates to this repository for the next 100 days (or less 🤞 ). Stay tuned for daily updates!

## 📝 What's Inside?

Here, you'll find:

- 📂 **Code snippets**: These are small pieces of Swift code that demonstrate various concepts and syntax.
- 📘 **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on how to build certain features or understand complex topics.
- 🧩 **Projects**: Larger scale works in progress as I continue to learn and experiment.

## 🙋‍♀️ How to Contribute

While this is a personal learning journey, I'm open to collaborations and contributions. If you have any additional resources or a better way to optimize some of my code, feel free to contribute:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create your **Feature Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a **Pull Request**
